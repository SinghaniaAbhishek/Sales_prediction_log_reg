# Sales Prediction using Logistic Regression

## Introduction
This project aims to predict sales outcomes using logistic regression. By analyzing the provided dataset, we build a predictive model to classify sales performance based on various features.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `DigitalAd_dataset.csv`. It contains the following columns:
- **Target**: The target variable indicating sales outcomes (e.g., 0 for no sale, 1 for sale).

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the data through visualization and statistical measures.
3. **Model Training**: Using logistic regression to train the model on the dataset.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Keshab1257/Sales_prediction_log_reg.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Sales_prediction_log_reg
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook `sales_pred.ipynb` to see the step-by-step implementation.
4. Alternatively, execute the Python script `sales_pred.py` for a streamlined version of the analysis.
